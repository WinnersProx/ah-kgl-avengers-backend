### CSS FRAMEWORK AND MOCK-UP TOOL

Authors Haven will be designed around [material design language](https://material.io/design/introduction/#principles). 
Material Design uses more grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such 
as lighting and shadows to deliver high-quality digital experiences. There many CSS frameworks already implementing 
Material Design and [the official site](https://material.io/) provides in-depth documentation about it.

For learning more about front-end we will implement components basing on the documentation found on [material.io](https://material.io/). 
If we decide to use a css framework, we will use [Materialize-CSS](https://materializecss.com/) for design mockup and
for React compatibility we will use [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/). 

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) will be used for mockup.
